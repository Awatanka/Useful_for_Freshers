 Although, you should tailor your questions to the specific situation, here are some examples of meaningful questions you can ask:
 <li> What frameworks, tech stack, tools, etc. does your team employ? </li>
 What do you like most about working here?
 Which development processes and tools do you implement?
How do you test your code?
Do you offer opportunities for professional development and training?
What’s the most challenging project you’ve worked on during your time in the company?
Is there anything about my resume/application that gives you pause? (This can be an effective way of getting ahead of anything on your application that the interviewers might think is a weakness/red flag) </p>
